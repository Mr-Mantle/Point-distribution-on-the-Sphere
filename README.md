# mathematical research: point distribution on the sphere
+ In this research, I focused on:
  - Explore the properties and structure of Veronoi cells
  
  - Proposed a method for verifying the special distribution based on optimization
  
  - Build connections to Tammes's problem, please refering [Tammes's Problem](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/teaching/courses/2009-08UVM-300/docs/others/1994/mooers1994a.pdf) to see more details about this problem.
 + Analysis the results

+ All the Matlab files can be found in: [files](Matlab%20files/)
+ Some beautiful pictures can be found in : [Pictures](Pictures/)
+ The report files can be found in: [report](final_version/)
